Bright and colorful points of interest are easy to create with planned spacing. A handy location near the kitchen can be a good spot for herbs, edible flowers and some vegetables. Large rows of tall potted plants create pathways while several pots of medium sized vegetation organized in a semi-circle invites chairs for a resting spot. The best thing of all though, is, taking a child to the nursery, selecting a container plant together and now we have a future gardener!",

Regardless of the geographic home of any Earth family participant, we need to be aware of a few Universal aspects of plant care as a baseline to gaining practical experience.
